# DSP48A1 Slice Implementation â€“ Spartan-6 FPGA

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project implements the **DSP48A1 slice** for the Xilinx Spartan-6 FPGA using **SystemVerilog**.  
The design follows the functional specifications of the DSP48A1 block, supporting configurable pipeline stages, multiple DSP operation modes, and cascade chaining.  
The project includes full RTL design, verification using QuestaSim, synthesis & implementation in Vivado, and linting validation.

## ðŸ”§ Features
- **Arithmetic Units**:
  - Pre-adder/subtractor for efficient DSP operations
  - 18Ã—18 multiplier with pipeline registers
  - 48-bit post-adder/subtractor with carry logic
- **Configurable Registers**:
  - A0/A1, B0/B1, C, D, M, and P register stages
- **Flexible Operation**:
  - Dynamic OPMODE control for arithmetic flexibility
  - Cascade connections: BCIN/BCOUT, PCIN/PCOUT
- **Verification**:
  - 4 directed verification paths covering all functional modes
  - Self-checking conditions with expected outputs

## ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies
- **SystemVerilog** â€“ RTL & Testbench
- **Xilinx Vivado** â€“ Elaboration, Synthesis, Implementation
- **QuestaSim** â€“ Simulation & Waveform Analysis
- **QuestLint** â€“ Linting and code quality checks

## ðŸ“Š Testbench & Verification
Testbench verifies:
1. **Reset operation** â€“ Ensures all outputs are cleared
2. **Path 1** â€“ Pre-subtractor + post-subtractor operation (`OPMODE = 8'b11011101`)
3. **Path 2** â€“ Pre-addition + post-addition operation (`OPMODE = 8'b00010000`)
4. **Path 3** â€“ P feedback through post-addition (`OPMODE = 8'b00001010`)
5. **Path 4** â€“ D:A:B concatenation + post-subtractor (`OPMODE = 8'b10100111`)

Expected outputs are compared automatically in the testbench, and all cases pass successfully.

---

## ðŸ“Š Results
- âœ… All verification cases passed with expected outputs
- âœ… Timing closure achieved at **100 MHz** (W5 pin constraint)
- âœ… Optimized resource utilization
- âœ… **Zero** linting errors
- âœ… Clean synthesis and implementation without critical warnings
